# About Me
I'm a 2024 Natural Sciences graduate that specialised in physics(mainly astrophysics and physical chemistry), coding, and Alzheimer's research.<br>
Throughout my degree I've had range of projects that required coding in Python and MATLAB. Below I've added some examples of my code to demostrate uses of:
<ul>
<li>Image and video analysis &#x2192 BZ Reaction, Zebrafish Motion Tracking</li>
<li>Data processing &#x2192 Spectrscopy Analysis</li>
<li>Object Orientated Programming &#x2192 Peg Solitaire</li>
</ul>

I really enjoyed the challenge working on these projects and I'm hoping to find a job where I am able to use my coding background more.

I also have some experience in linux using GROMACS for modelling molecular dynamics between proteins.<br>
